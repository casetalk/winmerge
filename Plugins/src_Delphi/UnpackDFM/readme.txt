UnpackDFM is a plugin for WinMerge which allows WinMerge to
compare and merge Delphi's binary dfm files.

The plugin does nothing if it is passed a text-based dfm
file. In this case, WinMerge will handle the comparison as
normal.

Written in and for Borland Delphi because all dfm files
may be binary.

No external requirement.
